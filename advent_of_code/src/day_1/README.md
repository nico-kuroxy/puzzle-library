# Day 1: Historian Hysteria

The [problem](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) for this day.

The first part aims to determine the total distance between two lists of positive integers (or IDs) of equal sizes. Even though the provided example contains duplicate IDs, the problem states that they should be unique (as it is the case in the puzzle input).

The second parts aims to determine the similarity between those two lists.

## Solution

The distance between the left and right lists is 2057374. This has been obtained with O(n log n) time complexity and 0(1) space complexity.  
The similarity between them is 23177084. This has been obtained with O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity.
