# Code base

This [repository](https://github.com/nico-kuroxy/puzzle-library) aims at aggregating the source code, solutions and documentation of the different coding exercises and brain-teaser that I encounter online.

As much as possible, the programmation is done in C++ (17) or Python (3.10) with the standard libraries provided by these languages. To compile the C++ code, with are using CMake (3.14).
