# First problem

The class implementing some functions to solve the first problem.

## How to run

To execute the C++ program of your choice, just use `./install/bin/problemX/your_executable. Make sure to replace **problemX**, **your_executable** by the proper file/folder names.

Eg:

- `./install/bin/problem1/problem1_exec`

If you are using Python instead, you first need to activate the Python virtual environement from this folder. Don't forget to disable it once you're done.

- `source scripts/bin/activate`
- `deactivate`

## How to test

As explained in the [Readme](../../README.md/#how-to-test) of the project, just use `ctest --test-dir build` to run all the GTest test case defined for this project.
